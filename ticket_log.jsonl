Please provide more details about your issue.\n\n**Knowledge Base Info:**\nExtension API\nVisual Studio Code is built with extensibility in mind. From the UI to the editing experience, almost every part of VS Code can be customized and enhanced through the Extension API. In fact, many core features of VS Code are built as extensions and use the same Extension API.\n\nThis documentation describes:\n\nHow to build, run, debug, test, and publish an extension\nHow to take advantage of VS Code's rich Extension API\nWhere to find guides and code samples to help get you started\nFollowing our UX guidelines for best practices\nCode samples are available at Microsoft/vscode-extension-samples.\n\nIf you are looking for published extensions, head to the VS Code Extension Marketplace.\n\nWhat can extensions do?\nHere are some examples of what you can achieve with the Extension API:\nPublishing Extensions\nOnce you have made a high-quality extension, you can publish it to the VS Code Extension Marketplace so others can find, download, and use your extension. Alternatively, you can package an extension into the installable VSIX format and share it with other users.\n\nThis topic covers:\n\nUsing vsce, the CLI tool for managing VS Code extensions\nPackaging, publishing and unpublishing extensions\nRegistering a publisher necessary for publishing extensions\nvsce\nvsce, short for \"Visual Studio Code Extensions\", is a command-line tool for packaging, publishing and managing VS Code extensions.\n\nInstallation\nMake sure you have Node.js installed. Then run:\n\nBash\n\nnpm install -g @vscode/vsce\nUsage\nYou can use vsce to easily package and publish your extensions:\n\nBash\nExtension Ideas\n\nBundle common JavaScript snippets into an extension.\nTell VS Code about a new programming language.\nAdd or replace the grammar for a programming language.\nExtend an existing grammar with grammar injections.\nPort an existing TextMate grammar to VS Code.\nProgrammatic Language Features\nProgrammatic Language Features add rich programming language support such as Hovers, Go to Definition, diagnostic errors, IntelliSense and CodeLens. These language features are exposed through the vscode.languages.* API. An extension can either use these APIs directly, or write a Language Server and adapt it to VS Code using the VS Code Language Server library.\n\nAlthough we provide a listing of language features and their intended usage, nothing prevents you from using these API creatively. For example, CodeLens and Hovers are a great way to present additional information inline, while diagnostic errors can be used to highlight spelling or code style errors.\n\nExtension Ideas\nExtension Ideas\n\nChange colors of your source code.\nChange colors of the VS Code UI.\nPort an existing TextMate theme to VS Code.\nAdd custom file icons.\nDeclarative Language Features\nDeclarative Language Features adds basic text editing support for a programming language such as bracket matching, auto-indentation and syntax highlighting. This is done declaratively, without writing any code. For more advanced language features, like IntelliSense or debugging, see Programmatic Language Features.\n\nExtension Ideas\nIf you are looking for published extensions, head to the VS Code Extension Marketplace.\n\nWhat can extensions do?\nHere are some examples of what you can achieve with the Extension API:\n\nChange the look of VS Code with a color or file icon theme - Theming\nAdd custom components & views in the UI - Extending the Workbench\nCreate a Webview to display a custom webpage built with HTML/CSS/JS - Webview Guide\nSupport a new programming language - Language Extensions Overview\nSupport debugging a specific runtime - Debugger Extension Guide\nIf you'd like to have a more comprehensive overview of the Extension API, refer to the Extension Capabilities Overview page. Extension Guides Overview also includes a list of code samples and guides that illustrate various Extension API usage.\n\nHow to build extensions?\nBuilding a good extension can take a lot of time and effort.
