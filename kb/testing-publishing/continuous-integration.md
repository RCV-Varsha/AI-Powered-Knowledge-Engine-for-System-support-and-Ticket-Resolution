Continuous Integration
Extension integration tests can be run on CI services. The @vscode/test-electron library helps you set up extension tests on CI providers and contains a sample extension setup on Azure Pipelines. You can check out the build pipeline or jump directly to the azure-pipelines.yml file.

Automated publishing
You can also configure the CI to publish a new version of the extension automatically.

The publish command is similar to publishing from a local environment using vsce, but you must somehow provide the Personal Access Token (PAT) in a secure way. By storing the PAT as a VSCE_PAT secret variable, vsce will be able to use it. Secret variables are never exposed, so they are safe to use in a CI pipeline.

Azure Pipelines
Azure Pipelines

Azure Pipelines is great for running VS Code extension tests as it supports running the tests on Windows, macOS, and Linux. For Open Source projects, you get unlimited minutes and 10 free parallel jobs. This section explains how to set up an Azure Pipelines for running your extension tests.

First, create a free account on Azure DevOps and create an Azure DevOps project for your extension.

Then, add the following azure-pipelines.yml file to the root of your extension's repository. Other than the xvfb setup script for Linux that is necessary to run VS Code in headless Linux CI machines, the definition is straight-forward:

YAML

trigger:
  branches:
    include:
    - main
  tags:
    include:
    - v*

strategy:
  matrix:
    linux:
      imageName: 'ubuntu-latest'
    mac:
      imageName: 'macos-latest'
    windows:
      imageName: 'windows-latest'

pool:
  vmImage: $(imageName)

steps:

- task: NodeTool@0
  inputs:
    versionSpec: '10.x'
  displayName: 'Install Node.js'

- bash: |
    /usr/bin/Xvfb :99 -screen 0 1024x768x24 > /dev/null 2>&1 &
    echo ">>> Started xvfb"
  displayName: Start xvfb
  condition: and(succeeded(), eq(variables['Agent.OS'], 'Linux'))

- bash: |
    echo ">>> Compile vscode-test"
    yarn && yarn compile
    echo ">>> Compiled vscode-test"
    cd sample
    echo ">>> Run sample integration test"
    yarn && yarn compile && yarn test
  displayName: Run Tests
  env:
    DISPLAY: ':99.0'
Finally, create a new pipeline in your DevOps project and point it to the azure-pipelines.yml file. Trigger a build and voilà:

pipelines

You can enable the build to run continuously when pushing to a branch and even on pull requests. See Build pipeline triggers to learn more.

Azure Pipelines automated publishing
Set up VSCE_PAT as a secret variable using the Azure DevOps secrets instructions.
Install vsce as a devDependencies (npm install @vscode/vsce --save-dev or yarn add @vscode/vsce --dev).
Declare a deploy script in package.json without the PAT (by default, vsce will use the VSCE_PAT environment variable as the Personal Access Token).
JSON

"scripts": {
  "deploy": "vsce publish --yarn"
}
Configure the CI so the build will also run when tags are created:
YAML

trigger:
  branches:
    include:
    - main
  tags:
    include:
    - refs/tags/v*
Add a publish step in azure-pipelines.yml that calls yarn deploy with the secret variable.
YAML

- bash: |
    echo ">>> Publish"
    yarn deploy
  displayName: Publish
  condition: and(succeeded(), startsWith(variables['Build.SourceBranch'], 'refs/tags/'), eq(variables['Agent.OS'], 'Linux'))
  env:
    VSCE_PAT: $(VSCE_PAT)
The condition property tells the CI to run the publish step only in certain cases.

In our example, the condition has three checks:

succeeded() - Publish only if the tests pass.
startsWith(variables['Build.SourceBranch'], 'refs/tags/') - Publish only if a tagged (release) build.
eq(variables['Agent.OS'], 'Linux') - Include if your build runs on multiple agents (Windows, Linux, etc.). If not, remove that part of the condition.
Since VSCE_PAT is a secret variable, it is not immediately usable as an environment variable. Thus, we need to explicitly map the environment variable VSCE_PAT to the secret variable.

GitHub Actions
You can also configure GitHub Actions to run your extension CI. In headless Linux CI machines xvfb is required to run VS Code, so if Linux is the current OS run the tests in an Xvfb enabled environment:

YAML

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [macos-latest, ubuntu-latest, windows-latest]
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    steps:
    - name: Checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - name: Install Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v4
      with:
        node-version: 18.x
    - run: npm install
    - run: xvfb-run -a npm test
      if: runner.os == 'Linux'
    - run: npm test
      if: runner.os != 'Linux'
GitHub Actions automated publishing
Set up VSCE_PAT as an encrypted secret using the GitHub Actions secrets instructions.
Install vsce as a devDependencies (npm install @vscode/vsce --save-dev or yarn add @vscode/vsce --dev).
Declare a deploy script in package.json without the PAT.
JSON

"scripts": {
  "deploy": "vsce publish --yarn"
}
Configure the CI so the build will also run when tags are created:
YAML

on:
  push:
    branches:
    - main
  release:
    types:
    - created
Add a publish job to the pipeline that calls npm run deploy with the secret variable.
YAML

- name: Publish
  if: success() && startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/') && matrix.os == 'ubuntu-latest'
  run: npm run deploy
  env:
    VSCE_PAT: ${{ secrets.VSCE_PAT }}
The if property tells the CI to run the publish step only in certain cases.

In our example, the condition has three checks:

success() - Publish only if the tests pass.
startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/') - Publish only if a tagged (release) build.
matrix.os == 'ubuntu-latest' - Include if your build runs on multiple agents (Windows, Linux, etc.). If not, remove that part of the condition.
GitLab CI
GitLab CI can be used to test and publish the extension in headless Docker containers. This can be done by pulling a preconfigured Docker image, or installing xvfb and the libraries required to run Visual Studio Code during the pipeline.

YAML

image: node:12-buster

before_script:
  - npm install

test:
  script:
    - |
      apt update
      apt install -y libasound2 libgbm1 libgtk-3-0 libnss3 xvfb
      xvfb-run -a npm run test
GitLab CI automated publishing
Set up VSCE_PAT as a masked variable using the GitLab CI documentation.
Install vsce as a devDependencies (npm install @vscode/vsce --save-dev or yarn add @vscode/vsce --dev).
Declare a deploy script in package.json without the PAT.
JSON

"scripts": {
  "deploy": "vsce publish --yarn"
}
Add a deploy job that calls npm run deploy with the masked variable which will only trigger on tags.
YAML

deploy:
  only:
    - tags
  script:
    - npm run deploy
Common questions
Do I need to use Yarn for continuous integration?
All of the above examples refer to a hypothetical project built with Yarn, but can be adapted to use npm, Grunt, Gulp, or any other JavaScript build tool.
